```🍕 Pizza Sales SQL Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project explores a Pizza Sales dataset containing 70,000+ rows across 4 relational tables:
orders → order date & time
order_details → individual items within each order
pizzas → pizza size and price
pizza_types → pizza names, categories, and ingredients

The goal was to practice SQL for data analysis and extract actionable business insights from real-world style sales data.

🎯 Objectives
Strengthen SQL query-writing skills from beginner to advanced level.
Solve 70+ SQL queries covering joins, aggregations, and window functions.
Analyze sales data to answer business-focused questions.
Build visualizations to communicate findings effectively.

🗄️ Dataset
Rows: 70,000+
Tables: 4 (orders, order_details, pizzas, pizza_types)
Largest table: order_details with ~50,000 rows
📂 Dataset is publicly available and used for practice purposes.

🔑 SQL Skills Practiced
✔ Joins across multiple tables
✔ Aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG, MAX, MIN)
✔ Filtering with WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING
✔ Sorting and ranking with ORDER BY, LIMIT
✔ Window functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK)
✔ Date & time functions for trend analysis

📊 Key Business Insights
🍕 Chicken pizzas contributed the highest revenue among categories.
📅 Orders peaked during lunch hours (12–2 PM), with a smaller spike at dinner.
📏 Large size pizzas generated the most revenue, though medium pizzas sold the highest volume.
🥇 The Barbecue Chicken Pizza (L) ranked among the top-selling items.
📈 Sales showed a steady monthly growth trend over the dataset period.

📈 Visualizations
To complement SQL analysis, I created visual dashboards:
Revenue by Pizza Category (Bar Chart)
Orders Over Time (Line Chart)
Top 5 Pizzas by Quantity Sold (Horizontal Bar)
Revenue by Pizza Size (Column Chart)
Peak Order Hours (Heatmap/Bar)
👉 Dashboards/screenshots are included in the Visualizations/ folder.
